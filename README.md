Estimate 1-day 95% Value at Risk (VaR) for a 4-stock portfolio using Python
# Portfolio Risk Assessment with 1-Day 95% VaR

This project estimates the 1-day risk of loss for a 4-stock portfolio (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon) using three different models:

- ðŸ“Š Normal Distribution (Parametric VaR)
- ðŸ§ª Studentâ€™s t-Distribution (Heavy-Tailed VaR)
- ðŸ“‰ Historical Simulation (Non-parametric)

## Tools Used
- Python
- yFinance
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scipy.stats

## What Youâ€™ll Find
- Jupyter Notebook with full analysis (`DAY_1.ipynb`)
- PowerPoint summary presentation (`.pptx`)
- PDF version for easy viewing
- Visuals: Rolling VaR, Drawdown, Correlation Heatmaps

## Key Takeaways
- Normal models often underestimate extreme losses
- Fat-tailed and historical models better capture real risk
- Diversification helps reduce overall volatility
